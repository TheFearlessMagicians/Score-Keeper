# Score-Keeper
Score Keeper for 'n' people!
A nice score tracking analytics tool
TODO --> MAKE HTML nicer Especially the buttons and elements under the "RS" ID.
TODO --> ADD D3.JS
TODO --> make the initalForm submit when pressing Enter as well. Some Jquery/DOM stuff i haven't sorted out. If you guys do please implement it :)
UPDATE: Realized the form can't be submitted, becuase on submit it is redirected to a different page, since we don't have another page set up, it will reload current page. This will put user back to the initial form.
